### README for Diabetes Prediction API Client

This script demonstrates how to send a JSON request to a machine learning model's API endpoint and receive a prediction. The script uses Python's `requests` library to make an HTTP POST request.

---

### Requirements

Before running this script, ensure the following are installed in your Python environment:

- **Python 3.x**
- **`requests` library**: Install it using `pip install requests`.

---

### Description

This script is designed to send input data (patient health parameters) to an API endpoint hosting a diabetes prediction model. The model processes the input and returns a prediction.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Input Data**: A dictionary contains various health parameters such as:
   - Pregnancies
   - Glucose level
   - Blood Pressure
   - Skin Thickness
   - Insulin level
   - BMI (Body Mass Index)
   - Diabetes Pedigree Function
   - Age
   
   Example:
   ```python
   input_data_for_model = {
       'Pregnancies': 6,
       'Glucose': 148,
       'BloodPressure': 72,
       'SkinThickness': 35,
       'Insulin': 0,
       'BMI': 33.6,
       'DiabetesPedigreeFunction': 0.627,
       'Age': 50
   }
   ```

2. **API Endpoint**: Replace the `url` variable with the endpoint URL of your deployed API.

3. **Send Request**: The script converts the input dictionary to JSON format and sends it as the body of a POST request to the API.

4. **Response**: The script prints the response from the API, which typically contains the model's prediction (e.g., whether the patient is diabetic or not).

---

### Usage

1. **Edit the `url` variable**: Replace `url` with the public URL of the API endpoint where the model is deployed.
   ```python
   url = 'https://your-api-endpoint-url'
   ```

2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

3. **Output**: The script will print the API's response to the console. Example:
   ```
   {"prediction": 1}
   ```

   Here, `1` might indicate a positive diabetes prediction.

---

### Example Scenario

If the API URL is `https://example.com/api/diabetes-predict` and the health parameters indicate a person with:
- 6 pregnancies
- Glucose level of 148
- Blood Pressure of 72 mm Hg

The script sends the data to the API, and the response might be:
```json
{"prediction": 1}
```

---

### Troubleshooting

- **Error: "ConnectionError"**
  - Ensure the `url` variable points to the correct API endpoint.
  
- **Error: "JSONDecodeError"**
  - Verify the server is returning valid JSON responses.

- **Unexpected Output**
  - Confirm that the input data is in the expected format for the model.

---

### Notes

- Always verify the API URL is accessible.
- Ensure input data matches the model's expected format.
- Secure sensitive information, such as API keys, if required.

Feel free to modify the script as needed to suit specific requirements.
